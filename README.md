# AngularCharGen
> You all start in a tavern...

## Description
This web app is a fun personal project I initially built to be able to randomly generate characters for TTRPGs (Table Top Roleplaying Games).
Users can create characters which are saved in local storage - no database/server required! On the Character Roster page they can be viewed, edited, and deleted.
Anyone can run it locally to use this app's features.
